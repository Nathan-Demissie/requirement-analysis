# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.


What is Requirement Analysis?

            Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in software development where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, examined, and documented to guide the design and implementation of a system.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?”

            Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
            Requirement Analysis is not just a preliminary step—it’s the cornerstone of successful software development. Here's why:
            
            1.  Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep
            Clear requirements reduce ambiguity and ensure all stakeholders share a common understanding.
            
            It helps avoid scope creep by locking down what will and won’t be included in the project.
            
            2.  Saves Time and Cost
            Catching misunderstandings early prevents costly rework later in development or post-deployment.
            
            Well-defined requirements streamline design, coding, and testing efforts.
            
            3.  Enhances Product Quality
            Requirements aligned with user needs lead to more usable, reliable, and effective software.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

            Requirement Gathering: Collect raw data from stakeholders about what they need from the system.
            
            Requirement Elicitation: Use techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops to uncover hidden needs and clarify expectations.
            
            Requirement Documentation: Organize and record requirements clearly in formats like user stories, use cases, or requirement specs.
            
            Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Examine requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness; use diagrams to visualize system behavior.
            
            Requirement Validation: Confirm that documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are ready for implementation.
