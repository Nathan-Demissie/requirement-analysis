# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.


What is Requirement Analysis?

            Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in software development where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, examined, and documented to guide the design and implementation of a system.

Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis is not just a preliminary step—it’s the cornerstone of successful software development. Here's why:

1.  Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep
Clear requirements reduce ambiguity and ensure all stakeholders share a common understanding.

It helps avoid scope creep by locking down what will and won’t be included in the project.

2.  Saves Time and Cost
Catching misunderstandings early prevents costly rework later in development or post-deployment.

Well-defined requirements streamline design, coding, and testing efforts.

3.  Enhances Product Quality
Requirements aligned with user needs lead to more usable, reliable, and effective software.

Acceptance criteria ensure that features meet expectations before release.
