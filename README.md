# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.


What is Requirement Analysis?

            Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in software development where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, examined, and documented to guide the design and implementation of a system.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?”

            Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
            Requirement Analysis is not just a preliminary step—it’s the cornerstone of successful software development. Here's why:
            
            1.  Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep
            Clear requirements reduce ambiguity and ensure all stakeholders share a common understanding.
            
            It helps avoid scope creep by locking down what will and won’t be included in the project.
            
            2.  Saves Time and Cost
            Catching misunderstandings early prevents costly rework later in development or post-deployment.
            
            Well-defined requirements streamline design, coding, and testing efforts.
            
            3.  Enhances Product Quality
            Requirements aligned with user needs lead to more usable, reliable, and effective software.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

            Requirement Gathering: Collect raw data from stakeholders about what they need from the system.
            
            Requirement Elicitation: Use techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops to uncover hidden needs and clarify expectations.
            
            Requirement Documentation: Organize and record requirements clearly in formats like user stories, use cases, or requirement specs.
            
            Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Examine requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness; use diagrams to visualize system behavior.
            
            Requirement Validation: Confirm that documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are ready for implementation.


Types of Requirements

            Functional Requirements
            Definition: Specific behaviors or functions the system must perform.
            
            Examples for Booking Management System:
            
            Users can create, view, and cancel bookings.
            
            Admins can manage booking schedules and availability.
            
            System sends confirmation emails after successful booking.
            
            Non-functional Requirements
            Definition: Quality attributes that define how the system performs.

            Examples:
            
            The system must load booking pages within 2 seconds.
            
            Data must be encrypted during transmission.
            
            The platform should support up to 10,000 concurrent users.

Use Case Diagrams

            What Are Use Case Diagrams?
            Use Case Diagrams are visual representations that show how users (called actors) interact with a system to achieve specific goals (use cases). They’re part of UML (Unified Modeling Language) and help outline system functionality from the user's perspective.
            
            Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
            Clarity: Simplifies complex requirements into easy-to-understand visuals.
            
            Communication: Bridges understanding between technical teams and stakeholders.
            
            Scope Definition: Helps identify system boundaries and user roles.
            
            Requirement Validation: Ensures all user interactions are captured and accounted for.
            
            Planning Aid: Guides development and testing by highlighting key functionalities.

Acceptance Criteria.

            Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis
            Acceptance Criteria are the conditions that a software feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders. They define the boundaries of a user story or requirement and ensure that everyone—developers, testers, and clients—has a shared understanding of what “done” looks like.
            
            Why They Matter:
            Clarity: Prevents ambiguity by specifying exact expectations.
            
            Testability: Enables QA teams to verify if a feature works as intended.
            
            Alignment: Ensures the final product meets business and user goals.
            
            Scope Control: Helps avoid feature creep by locking down requirements.
